# Project Description

This project is a study on key iOS development concepts, with a focus on **ViewCode**, **Separation of Responsibilities**, **MVP Architecture with Interactor**, and **Async/Await**. The UI was forked from Alura, and the implementation of the **MVP pattern** was continued to include business logic and API integration using **The Movie DB API**.

## Key Concepts:

- **ViewCode**: Demonstrates the use of programmatic UI development, eliminating the need for Storyboards or XIBs.
- **Separation of Responsibilities**: Encourages the division of logic into distinct layers, making the code more maintainable and scalable.
- **MVP (Model-View-Presenter) with Interactor**: Implements the MVP architectural pattern, where the **Presenter** communicates with the **View**, and the **Interactor** handles the business logic and API calls.
- **Async/Await**: Introduces Swift's modern concurrency model to handle asynchronous operations, such as network requests, in a more readable and efficient way.
- **The Movie DB API**: Uses the API to fetch movie data, providing real-world examples of how to integrate third-party services in iOS applications.

This project began as a UI-focused study from Alura, and was further developed to implement a full **MVP architecture** for handling business logic, data fetching, and presentation.

It serves as a learning tool for developers aiming to improve their skills in building clean, maintainable, and scalable iOS applications, with a special focus on architecture and third-party API integration.
